----

This extension brings a very flexible and very, very, very fast cache to TYPO3.
It creates temporary HTML files from static pages and redirects the visitor to
the HTML file without loading TYPO3 at all. Your server, whether Apache or Nginx,
has less work and consumes less power as a result.

Have fun with the extension!

*Note:* This extension is a fork of `EXT:nc_staticfilecache` (before
`EXT:fl_staticfilecache`) and has a lot of improvements. Replace the previous
ones with this one if possible.
